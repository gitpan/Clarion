Clarion.pm version 1.02
=======================

Clarion.pm - Perl module for reading CLARION 2.1 data files

NOTE

This version is for Little-endian architectire only,
as Clarion 2.1 itself runs only on Intel.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

or, alternatively, you may type:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

or, since Clarion.pm is pure perl, you can simply copy it to your perl's @INC.

BUGS

Sometimes ./Build test (or make test) fails comparing floating point numbers
(eg. got '4.04000000000000004', expected '4.04'). Probably such errors could
be ignored.
